news = """He may have quit the British Royal Family and moved to California with his wife Meghan and their children, but the Duke of Sussex proved he was far from leaving the past behind him, when in January he released his autobiography Spare, and pulled no punches. Bearing the Prince's distinct tone of voice and turn of phrase, the book – though ghost-written by JR Moehringer – was as candid as they come, generating acres of headlines with its more sensational stories, revelations and claims. From detailing his alleged fisticuffs with the Prince of Wales to a case of frostbite on his genitalia during Prince William and Catherine's wedding, there was seemingly no filter applied. Perhaps as a result, according to Guinness World Records, Spare became "the fastest selling non-fiction book of all time" on the date of its release. But while Prince Harry will have been celebrating his literary success, his father King Charles III was reported to be "hurt and dismayed" by the publication. And the year was literally book-ended by scandalous royal tomes, when in December royal reporter Omid Scobie released his own book, Endgame. It again detailed alleged royal tensions, and caused particular controversy when a Dutch edition of the book was erroneously published naming King Charles and Catherine as the royals who allegedly discussed the potential skin colour of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's first child."""
